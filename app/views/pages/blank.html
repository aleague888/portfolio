				I am a former helicopter mechanic - turned web developer from northern Alabama.  I have been fortunate to have travelled quite a bit and see a lot of adventure!  Working through school, I got a contract in Charleston, SC.  That's where I found out about The Iron Yard coding bootcamp and decided to give it a try.  I am extremely glad I did because it's been one of the best decisions I've made!  Since then, It's been a bit of a whirlwind - working with the brightest (and probably the craziest) people who make you realize that there really is no limit to what you can do!
